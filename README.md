# Garbage OS
Garbage OS, or GOS for short, is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept Operating System that comes with a built-in garbage collector.

GOS is not intended to replace any of the existing operating systems, however, it is meant to see what performance boost, if any, arises from consolodating Garbage-Collection 
services to the max - something achieved with GOS as there is only one Garbage Collector. 

GOS is also a BOOTBOOT compliant Operating System, you can find the source code for BOOTBOOT here: https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/bootboot/-/tree/master.
What complying with BOOTBOOT means for an end-user is that one can directly boot GOS or chainload it from GRUB. GOS is set up to use BOOTBOOT as an efi loader (meaning it works with UEFI).

__**I make no warranty with Garbage OS, nor will I ever.**__
That being said, if you want to try it out or contribute something, feel free to do so.

## Documentation
Almost everything in Garbage OS is documented [here](./docs/index.html)

## Compiling yourself.

### Prerequisites:

 - GCC, Make, LD, and other generic C toolchain programs. I am 75% certain that the code will not compile on msvc. I have not tested CLANG.
 - gnuefi / some replacement for efi.h and its dependencies. 
 - the password. For some reason (at least on wsl2), using losetup (how the makefile creates the image) requires root permissions. If you feel uncomfortable allowing some program from the internet access to root, you can look at the make file yourself or edit the makefile on your end. 

### The build process
1. Ensure that no loop devices are in use. You can perform this check with the command `losetup -a` or by running `make looplist`. If there are no open loop devices, `losetup -a` will exit without any output. 
2. Run the command `make all -B`. `-B` ensures that all files are remade - even if up to date. Alternatively you could run `make preclean build_kernel clean -B` if you want to skip the documentation-building step. If you are building for the first time after cloning the repository, `-B` should not be required.
3. The output will be in gos/disk/gos.img. You can run this output in Qemu (I have not gotten it to work in VirtualBox yet), or, theoretically, on real hardware. Currently, GOS only supports x64-based UEFI machines. However, only slight configuration changes are required to support aarch64-based UEFI or BIOS-based x64. 
4. GOS does not currently support chainloading via grub, however, BOOTBOOT has information on how to load a BOOTBOOT-Compliant OS through Multiboot.

## BOOTBOOT loader, standard, and image creator.
You can find the README.md for mkbootimg, part of the BOOTBOOT repository and the program that assembles the final disk image for GOS, [here](./mkbootimg/README.md)

## Roadmap
 - Boot in a stable manner that accounts for the unique differences in every computer. (âœ”)
   + Initialize memory, i.e., the page table around MMIO devices and "dead memory" - handled by BOOTBOOT
   + Setup IDT (and test)
 - Implement a Garbage Collector service, kind of obvious since that's the entire point of this project.
 - Implement preemptive multitasking - this algorithm absolutely needs to be **superfast**.
   + After around 20 min research on OSDev wiki, I am leaning towards implementing a priority based Round Robin.
   + Keep track of processes that are currently running (although, we have to do that for GC).
 - Implement some Open Source Quality of Life improvements
   + ext-based filesystem. Since there is already an extremely popular implementation on GitHub, I might check how it works - implementing it myself
   + elf executable file format (or a modification of that). ELF is simple, fast, and well documented.
 - Implement GUI (BOOTBOOT sets up graphical framebuffer, so GUI becomes a *task*).
 - See if and where it goes from here.

## Security flaws.

General disclaimer, repeated once more: I make no warranty on this software, nor do I promise that it will do anything.

If I am doing anything wrong, please tell me and I will fix it.

As of the current version of Garbage OS, there is likely not any information to accidently make vulnerable via a security bug. However, if I have messed up a security mechanism beyond what any contributor seems capable of, it is probably a very critical error and needs to be fixed ASAP.

### Version Support

Here is a neat little placeholder-table.

| version number | support state | date state last changed |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| all versions   |      N/A      |           N/A           |
