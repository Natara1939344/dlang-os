# Security Policy
All security bugs must be reported for all versions. 

# Known Exploits
As of the time of writing, there are no known exploits in any version of Garbage OS. 

Remember, no software or hardware implementation can be given a certain guarantee of *complete security*. Before the discovery of Spectre-class exploits, for example, it was believed that the hardware which enables them (a combination of Superscalar Out of Order Processing and Speculative Execution) was entirely secure. Well known software-developing leaders such as Microsoft and Apple regularly find security vulnerabilities in their products.
