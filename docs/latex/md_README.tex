Garbage OS, or G\+OS for short, is a work-\/in-\/progress proof-\/of-\/concept Operating System that comes with a built-\/in garbage collector.

G\+OS is not intended to replace any of the existing operating systems, however, it is meant to see what performance boost, if any, arises from consolodating Garbage-\/\+Collection services to the max -\/ something achieved with G\+OS as there is only one Garbage Collector.

G\+OS is also a B\+O\+O\+T\+B\+O\+OT compliant Operating System, you can find the source code for B\+O\+O\+T\+B\+O\+OT here\+: \href{https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/bootboot/-/tree/master}{\texttt{ https\+://gitlab.\+com/bztsrc/bootboot/-\//tree/master}}. What complying with B\+O\+O\+T\+B\+O\+OT means for an end-\/user is that one can directly boot G\+OS or chainload it from G\+R\+UB. G\+OS is set up to use B\+O\+O\+T\+B\+O\+OT as an efi loader (meaning it works with U\+E\+FI).

{\bfseries{{\bfseries{I make no warranty with Garbage OS, nor will I ever.}}}} That being said, if you want to try it out or contribute something, feel free to do so.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Roadmap}\label{md_README_autotoc_md13}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Boot in a stable manner that accounts for the unique differences in every computer. (âœ”)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initialize memory, i.\+e., the page table around M\+M\+IO devices and \char`\"{}dead memory\char`\"{} -\/ handled by B\+O\+O\+T\+B\+O\+OT
\item Setup I\+DT (and test)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Implement a Garbage Collector service, kind of obvious since that\textquotesingle{}s the entire point of this project.
\item Implement preemptive multitasking -\/ this algorithm absolutely needs to be {\bfseries{superfast}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item After around 20 min research on O\+S\+Dev wiki, I am leaning towards implementing a priority based Round Robin.
\item Keep track of processes that are currently running (although, we have to do that for GC).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Implement some Open Source Quality of Life improvements
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ext-\/based filesystem. Since there is already an extremely popular implementation on Git\+Hub, I might check how it works -\/ implementing it myself
\item elf executable file format (or a modification of that). E\+LF is simple, fast, and well documented.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Implement G\+UI (B\+O\+O\+T\+B\+O\+OT sets up graphical framebuffer, so G\+UI becomes a {\itshape task}).
\item See if and where it goes from here.

General disclaimer, repeated once more\+: I make no warranty on this software, nor do I promise that it will do anything.

If I am doing anything wrong, please tell me and I will fix it.

As of the current version of Garbage OS, there is likely not any information to accidently make vulnerable via a security bug. However, if I have messed up a security mechanism beyond what any contributor seems capable of, it is probably a very critical error and needs to be fixed A\+S\+AP.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsection{Version Support}\label{md_README_autotoc_md16}
